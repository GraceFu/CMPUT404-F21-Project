# Communiti


Communiti is a blogging/social network platform that will allow the importing of other sources of posts (github, twitter, etc.) as well allow the distributing sharing of posts and content. This project is initially made for CMPUT404 Fall 2021 at University of Alberta.

## Heroku App

https://cmput404-proj-social-app.herokuapp.com/

## Local Deployment

### Prerequisite

- Python 3.6+
- Django
- django-crispy-forms 
- djangorestframework
- (Recommended) Python virtual environment

We recommend installing all the dependencies by running `pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

### Instructions

1. `git clone` this repo
2. `cd CMPUT404-F21-Project` to navigate to the project folder
3. `python3 manage.py makemigrations api` to make the migrations of models
4. `python3 manage.py migrate` to apply migrations
5. `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin account.
6. `python3 manage.py runserver`. After this, you should be able to access the app on your local host.

### Admin Control
Since we do not have a separate admin panel yet, admin can now approve new users' signup requests by visiting `localhost/admin` and manually activate users by going to specific user in the Users tab in the left navigation bar in the admin page
